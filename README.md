# Eureka Server

## Service Description:
The Eureka Server is a crucial microservice that acts as a service registry in a microservices architecture. It registers and manages other microservices, allowing them to discover and communicate with each other dynamically. This enables seamless interaction between services without needing to know each other's physical locations. The Eureka Server plays a central role in ensuring the resilience and scalability of the system by facilitating service discovery.
